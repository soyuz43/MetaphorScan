ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH USE NOTICE:

This software implements analysis methods inspired by academic research on AI 
discourse and metaphor analysis. The theoretical framework is based on:

- "The Nuremberg Defense of AI" 
- "AI as an Epistemic Void Generator"
- "The Alignment Problem as Epistemic Autoimmunity"

Users are encouraged to cite the relevant academic works when using this 
software for research purposes. The goal of this project is to promote 
epistemic clarity in AI research and discourse through systematic analysis 
of metaphorical language patterns.

ETHICAL USE GUIDELINES:

This tool is designed to:
✓ Promote clearer communication in AI research
✓ Identify potentially misleading metaphors in technical discourse  
✓ Support more precise academic and professional language
✓ Advance understanding of how language shapes AI discourse

This tool should NOT be used to:
✗ Censor legitimate academic expression
✗ Suppress diverse perspectives on AI development
✗ Replace human judgment in editorial decisions
✗ Automatically reject papers based solely on metaphor usage

The analysis provided by this software should be considered as one input 
among many in the process of improving clarity and precision in AI discourse.
